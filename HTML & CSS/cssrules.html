        <p class="yellow rounded">An element's width is controlled by the width attribute. The max-width attribute controls an element's maximum width. The minimum width of an element is determined via the min-width attribute.</p>
        <p class="yellow shadow">A shadow effect is added to an element using the box-shadow attribute. It enables you to customize the shadow's color, blur radius, spread radius, and horizontal and vertical offset.</p>
        <p class="seethrough">The opacity/transparency of an element is defined by its opacity attribute. When an element has an opacity value of 1.0, it is fully opaque; when it has a value of 0.5, it is 50% transparent.</p>
