			<h3>My personal process for accumulating capital after years of research.</h3>
			<p>Four components make up the capital accumulation process: cash flow (saving), cash flow (skills), money management 90% (indices), and money management 10% (enterprising).</p>
            <p>Goal: <b><i>To flow cash better than average into a good as market average or better return.</i></b></p>

			<p>On March 14, 2023, according to Market Watch's article "U.S. stocks open higher after headline CPI data show February inflation was in line with expectations." The latest inflation report comes after months of concerns about rising inflation and the potential impact on the economy and the stock market. However, the report showed that inflation in February was 0.4%, which was in line with economists' expectations. This news eased concerns among investors and led to a rally in the stock market. This has raised hopes that the economy will continue to recover and grow, which is positive for the stock market.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			<p>As the legendary investor Benjamin Graham once said, "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine." This quote suggests that in the short term, the market can be swayed by emotions and sentiment, but over the long term, the market tends to reflect the true value of companies. The recent market rally is a reminder that in the short term, market movements can be unpredictable and driven by a variety of factors, including news and economic data. However, over the long term, the stock market tends to reflect the underlying fundamentals of the economy and individual companies.</p>
			
			
			
			
			
			<p>As Warren Buffett once said, "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." This quote emphasizes the importance of focusing on the intrinsic value of a company rather than its current stock price. Buffett has been a longtime advocate of value investing, which involves identifying undervalued companies with strong fundamentals and holding onto them for the long term. The recent market rally highlights the importance of investing in companies with strong fundamentals and a long-term outlook. While short-term market movements can be unpredictable, companies with solid financials and a sustainable competitive advantage are likely to generate returns for investors over the long term.</p>
