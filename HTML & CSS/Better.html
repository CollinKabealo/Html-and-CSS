			<p>Investing is an art that requires a unique combination of skills, knowledge, and patience. Being an enterprising investor means that one is willing to go beyond the conventional norms of investing to identify opportunities that are mispriced by the market. Benjamin Graham, the father of value investing, and Warren Buffet, one of the most successful investors of all time, are two of the most notable figures in the history of investing who have espoused the virtues of enterprising investing. In this essay, we will discuss the process of being an enterprising investor, the importance of a margin of safety, and how the market miss-prices securities from time to time.</p>
			
			
			
			<p>The first step in being an enterprising investor is to conduct thorough research on the company or industry that one is interested in investing in. This involves analyzing the financial statements of the company, assessing the strength of its management team, and understanding the competitive landscape. As Graham notes in his book, The Intelligent Investor, investors must be able to distinguish between a company's intrinsic value and its market price. The intrinsic value is the true value of a company, while the market price is simply what the market is willing to pay for the company's shares.</p>
			
			 
            
            
			
			<p>The next step in being an enterprising investor is to identify companies that are trading at a discount to their intrinsic value. This is where the concept of a margin of safety comes into play. A margin of safety is a financial cushion that investors build into their investment decisions to protect themselves against losses. As Buffet notes, "Rule number one: Never lose money. Rule number two: Never forget rule number one." By investing in companies with a margin of safety, investors can reduce the risk of losing money on their investments.</p>
			

			
			<p>One of the key advantages of being an enterprising investor is the ability to identify mispricing's in the market. The market is not always efficient, and from time to time, securities can become mispriced due to a variety of factors such as panic selling, market overreactions, or temporary setbacks. This is where enterprising investors can capitalize on these opportunities by purchasing shares of companies that have temporarily fallen out of favor. As Graham notes, "In the short run, the market is a voting machine, but in the long run, it is a weighing machine."</p>
			
			
			
			<p>Furthermore, enterprising investors recognize that bad news can often make stocks cheap and an attractive buy for the long-term investor. For instance, during the COVID-19 pandemic, many companies were heavily impacted by the economic slowdown and market volatility, causing their stock prices to plummet. However, enterprising investors who recognized the intrinsic value of these companies were able to take advantage of the temporary mispricing in the market and purchase shares at attractive prices.</p>
			
			
			
			<p>In conclusion, being an enterprising investor requires a unique combination of skills, knowledge, and patience. It involves conducting thorough research, identifying mispricing’s in the market, and investing in companies with a margin of safety. By following the principles espoused by Graham and Buffet, investors can increase their chances of generating superior returns over the long term.</p>
